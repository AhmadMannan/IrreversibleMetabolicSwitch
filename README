This repository contains the MATLAB .m scripts of the models and analyses reported in the published work
Mannan AA and Bates DG (2020) "Designing an irreversible metabolic switch for scalable induction of microbial chemical production", Nature Communications.

All scripts that perform analyses and reproduce the plots of the paper are named "A[#1]_... .m" and can simply be run in MATLAB. Note all scripts were developed in MATLAB 2018a and use functions from the ODE suite, Optimization suite, Global Optimization suite and others.

Here we briefly describe what each analysis script does, but do not describe the subscripts developed to make them run, what we call the method scripts (named "m_ ... .m"):
